# For Demo only

Example react native implementation using mobile js sdk

## Notes

Rename `_package.json` file to `package.json`. To prevent installation of node_modules from this project. Sometimes yarn automatically installs packages even if the directory is outside the lib folder.

Also, move the react demo folder to a sibling path.
